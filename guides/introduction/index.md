Ember relies on its community to grow and evolve. We value the ideas, suggestions and contributions that community members provide to improve the framework, related tooling, addons and documentation. And we value the efforts by those who organise, manage and lead initiatives and events and by those who write, record and publish Ember specific learning resources that help educate other members of the community.

Since the very beginning of this project, the community behind Ember subscribed to the concept of open source to facilitate the development of the project and its community.


# Why Open Source Is so Important to Us

Based on the open source model, today many software projects are developed and managed by a global community in a decentralised manner. The majority of open source software (OSS) is free to use by anyone, is eligible to be modified and be used in other contexts and its source code is publicly available.

We believe in the power of collaborative work as part of the open source model and the diversity of ideas that contributors bring to Ember.
